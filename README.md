jhML : A Useful Deep Learning Framework Implemented by jhson   
jhML framework is originated from "dezero" project, and some more useful utilities will be added. Feel free to use this framework to study concepts of modern deep learning frameworks and a dynamic graph. jhML contains data structures for multi-dimensional tensors and defines mathematical operations over these tensors. Additionally, it provides utilities for developing deep learning applications  
  
It will support GPGPU features, so you can run your tensor computations on an GPU someday. :)
