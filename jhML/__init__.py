jhML : A Useful Deep Learning Framework Implemented by jhson, Korea
jhML framework is originated from "dezero" project, and some 
more useful utilities are added. Feel free to use this framework to study
concepts of modern deep learning frameworks and a dynamic graph.
jhML contains data structures for multi-dimensional tensors 
and defines mathematical operations over these tensors.
Additionally, it provides some utilities for developing deep learning applications

It will have a GPGPU counterpart, so you can run your tensor computations on an GPU someday
